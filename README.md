A small **Dockerized Django project exposing a GraphQL API for managing recipes and ingredients**. It uses:

  

- **Django** (REST framework for serializers)

- **Strawberry for GraphQL**

- **djangorestframework-simplejwt** for JWT authentication

- **PostgreSQL** via Docker Compose

- **WhiteNoise** to serve static files (admin UI)

  

This README explains how to run the project locally with Docker, how to use the GraphQL API (with JWT authentication), and where to find the main code pieces.

  

## ‚öñÔ∏è Repository layout

  

- **`manage.py`** - Django management script

- **`schema.py`** - (project-level) Strawberry schema entrypoint

- **`config/`** - Django project settings, URLs and WSGI

- **`config/settings/`** - base & environment settings

- **`recipe/`** - Django app with models, serializers and GraphQL schema

- **`recipe/schema.py`** - Strawberry types, queries and mutations

- **`recipe/serializers.py`** - DRF serializers used by GraphQL mutations

- **`recipe/urls.py`** - app-level GraphQL route wrapper

  

Other important files:

  

- **`Dockerfile`**, **`docker-compose.yml`** - Docker configuration

- **`docker-compose.override.yml`** - development override (runs gunicorn with `--reload`)

- **`.env`** - environment variables used by Docker and Django (should not be committed)

  

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick start (Docker)

  

Prerequisites: Docker and Docker Compose installed.

  

1. Create or copy a `.env` file at the project root and set at minimum:

  

- `POSTGRES_DB`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (required by Postgres image on first init)

- `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, `ALLOWED_HOSTS`

  

2. Build and start the services:

  

```powershell

docker-compose up --build

```

  

To run detached and tail logs:

  

```powershell

docker-compose up --build -d

docker-compose logs -f web

```

  

The `docker-compose.override.yml` file (if present) will cause the `web` service to run Gunicorn with `--reload` in development so changes are picked up without rebuilding.

  

3. Inside the `web` container create a superuser if you need admin access:

  

```powershell

docker-compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser

```

  

4. Run migrations (if not already applied by container startup):

  

```powershell

docker-compose run web python manage.py makemigrations

docker-compose run web python manage.py migrate

```

  

## üñ•Ô∏è Static files / Admin UI

  

Static files are collected during the Docker build and served by **WhiteNoise**. If the Django admin appears unstyled:

  

- Confirm `whitenoise` is present in `requirements.txt` and `WhiteNoiseMiddleware` is added to `MIDDLEWARE` in `config/settings/base.py`.

- Rebuild the image so `collectstatic` runs with the current project files:

  

```powershell

docker-compose up --build

```

  

Then open the admin at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and log in with the superuser.

  

## üçì GraphQL API

  

- GraphQL endpoint: `POST /graphql/`

- JWT token endpoint: `POST /api/token/` (DRF SimpleJWT)

  

Authentication: obtain an `access` token from `/api/token/` and include it on GraphQL requests using the `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header. The project wires JWT authentication at the GraphQL URL wrapper and resolvers expect `info.context['request']` to contain the Django request.

  

Example: obtain a token with curl (PowerShell):

  

```powershell

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/token/  -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d '{"username":"<username>","password":"<password>"}'

```

  

Example GraphQL query (ingredients):

  

```graphql

query  {

ingredients(search: "salt",  first: 10,  offset: 0)  {

id

name

description

}

}

```

  

Call via curl (replace `<ACCESS_TOKEN>`):

  

```powershell

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/graphql/  -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"  -d '{"query":"query { ingredients(first: 10) { id name } }"}'

```

  

Example GraphQL mutation (create a recipe with ingredient IDs):

  

```graphql

mutation  {

createRecipe(name: "Pasta",  instructions: "Boil.",  ingredientIds: [1,2])  {

id

name

ingredientCount

ingredients  {  id  name  }

}

}

```

  

Call it via curl:

  

```powershell

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/graphql/  -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>"  -d '{"query":"mutation { createRecipe(name:\"Pasta\", instructions:\"Boil.\", ingredientIds:[1,2]) { id name ingredients { id name } } }"}'

```

  

Mutations and queries are implemented in `recipe/schema.py` and mutations generally use DRF serializers found in `recipe/serializers.py` for validation and creation.

  

## üìö Development notes

  

- **Schema location**: `recipe/schema.py`. Resolvers receive `info.context['request']` with the Django `request` set by the GraphQL URL wrapper.

- **JWT auth**:  `recipe/urls.py` include a small wrapper that authenticates using DRF's `JWTAuthentication` and sets `request.user` before invoking the Strawberry `GraphQLView`.

- **Permissions**: Strawberry permission classes (e.g. an `IsAuthenticated` permission) used to avoid repeating authentication checks in every resolver.

- **Performance**: The `recipes` resolver uses `prefetch_related('ingredients')` to avoid N+1 queries when resolving nested ingredients.

  

  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

  

- "Database is uninitialized and superuser password is not specified": make sure `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is set in `.env` so the Postgres container initializes.

- `relation 'recipe_recipe' does not exist`: run migrations with `python manage.py migrate` inside the `web` service.

- Admin static assets 404: rebuild image so `collectstatic` runs and verify WhiteNoise is configured in `config/settings/base.py`.

  

## üî¨ Next steps / improvements

  

- Add unit and integration tests for GraphQL resolvers and mutations.

- Add role-based authorization or more granular permissions.
